# WindowsXBOX-Teredo-Fixxer
This simple .bat can be used if you can not connect to XBOX Service on Windows. It will automaticlly set the Teredo Adapter up.

STEP ONE: Run as Administrator
STEP TWO: Type Number and press ENTER

Info: You can check the adapter status first before changing anything, use option "2" first.

END: If you are worried the Batch could damage your PC, just edit it.... i mean... you have a Monitor? ^^
